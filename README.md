# Employee-Turnover-Prediction

Employee Turnover Prediction means to predict whether an employee is going to leave the organization in the coming period.

A Company uses this predictive analysis to measure how many employees they will need if the potential employees will leave their organization. A company also uses this predictive analysis to make the workplace better for employees by understanding the core reasons for the high turnover ratio.

After calculating accuracy, f1 score from various models like Random Forest, KNN , XGBoost , etc. I have selected Random forest as it was providing highest accuracy.

Further for front end , I have used Flask then deployed model on Heroku .
